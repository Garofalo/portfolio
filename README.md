## About Me

  I take great pride in my ability to creatively and efficiently solve problems. Full Stack Software Engineering allows me to fulfill my need to be creative **and** scratch my problem solving itch while my professional skillset gets sharper. Truly a lifelong learner, my approach to learning a skill has led me to teach peers in a wide variety of topics - from Tang Soo Do as a teenager(a Korean martial art), to sales in my 20s, to professionally tasting (read: drinking) beer in my late 20s and early 30s. I have that same desire to learn and hone the skill of Software Development, so I spend my days coding. That feeling of finally figuring out a problem and everything just **clicks** into place is my daily white whale.
