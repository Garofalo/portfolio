        info: "Let's get the unfun stuff out of the way first - I was orphaned at 15 and unfulfillingly spent the next 10 years or so bouncing from place to place. I lived in adversity and, because of my traumas, actively sought it out. This led me to live in Philadelphia, Waikiki, DC, Maryland, and a few other places for brief stints. I eventually  landed on my feet from a combination of luck, moxie, and stubbornness. For almost seven years, I sold beer at the largest wholesaler in Philadelphia, where I rose to every challenge, was given more and more responsibility, and eventually had the biggest territory in the company. I left that job when I found a partner and finally saw a vision for my future. She gave me the space to make mistakes and her support lead me down the developer's path. I've been coding for almost two years now. My life experiences mean I revel in challenges and have the mindset it takes to overcome them. I learn something every day."

        title: "My Approach as a Developer",
        info: "“Figuring it out” is my specialty. I am extremely quick on my feet and used to solely rely on that to get the job done, but I have quickly learned that meticulous project planning is the key to success in our world. When something (inevitably) doesn't go to plan, I know from experience that I am capable of handling whatever is thrown at me. Development is a lot like building a house, in that, you could have the best wood, nails, and hammer in the world, but a good carpenter knows when you need a saw. I know how to find and apply the right tool for the job, and the same problem never stumps me twice. But other ones do. And I figure those out as well."
